<h3>That's a Capricorn symbol! Are you into astrology?</h3>
<p>
	Sorry, but no, not really. I enjoy <i>Final Fantasy Tactics</i>, which has
	a neat zodiac play mechanic, and I think that Capricorn has a pretty cool
	symbol, which is why I'm using it here, but I don't take any real stock in
	horoscopes. If you talk to me about it for a long time (which happens from
	time to time in LA), I will nod and smile politely until you are finished.
