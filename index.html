<h1>Pardon my dust.</h1>
<p>
	I'm still building out this site, so there's not much here at the moment.
	You can get a bit more information at <a href="https://chrisfincher.com">my outgoing homepage</a>.

<h3>Wait. Let me explain.</h3>
<p>
	Not "computer person" like "half-computer, half-man"
	<span class="aside">(I'd have a cooler name if that were true...)</span>,
	but "computer person" like "person that works with computers".
</p>
